[Peteris Krumins](http://www.catonmat.net/http-proxy-in-nodejs/):

> This is just amazing. In 20 lines of node.js code and 10 minutes of time I was able to write a HTTP proxy. And it scales well, too. It's not a blocking HTTP proxy, it's event driven and asynchronous, meaning hundreds of people can use simultaneously and it will work well.

Might come in handy from time to time.
