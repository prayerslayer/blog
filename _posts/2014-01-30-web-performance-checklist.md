> Delivering an awesome experience at 60fps is the goal, and we’ll target anything blocking us from doing that. To put this another way: any frame that takes longer than 16ms (1/60th of a second) for the browser to generate is a problem. There are several parts of a frame’s life cycle and, unsurprisingly, nearly all of them can cause you to drop frames.
