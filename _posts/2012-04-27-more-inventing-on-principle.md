[Light Table](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table):

> Light Table is based on a very simple idea: we need a real work surface to code on, not just an editor and a project explorer. We need to be able to move things around, keep clutter down, and bring information to the foreground in the places we need it most.
