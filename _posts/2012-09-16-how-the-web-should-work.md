[Boris Smus](http://smus.com/how-the-web-should-work/), Chrome developer relations:

> The basic idea is to hit the ground running with a prototype developed in JavaScript, get early feedback and then propose to W3C when you are ready.
>
> 1. Propose a sane API that developers can use & implement it on top of existing API(s). (web developer)
> 2. Solicit adoption and iterate on feedback. (web developer)
> 3. Push through standardization. (spec author)
> 4. Implement natively in browsers. (browser vendor)

Indeed!
