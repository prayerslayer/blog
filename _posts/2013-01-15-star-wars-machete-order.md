[Rod Hilton](http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/) schlägt vor, dass Star Wars in der Reihenfolge 4, 5, 2, 3, 6 gekuckt werden sollte:

> Search your feelings, you know it to be true! Episode I doesn’t matter at all. You can start the prequels with Episode II and miss absolutely nothing. The opening crawl of Episode II establishes everything you need to know about the prequels: a bunch of systems want to leave the Republic, they are led by Count Dooku, and Senator Amidala is a senator who is going to vote on whether the Republic is going to create an army. Natalie Portman is called Senator Amidala twice in the first 4 minutes of the movie, so there’s no question of who’s who.

Klingt absolut vielversprechend, müsste man mal ausprobieren. Keine Midichlorianer!
