>I think there are a few problems with the current environment, though some are subjective. The first of these and the most important in my opinion is the lack of unification around package consumption and definitions. The second issue is package delivery, whatâ€™s going to transport them to your machine? The final issue is the use of the components, how are they exposed to the browser for your application.
