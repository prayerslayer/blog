[Michael Mace](http://mobileopportunity.blogspot.de/2012/05/fear-and-loathing-and-windows-8.html) Ã¼ber Windows 8, ein Must-Read:
> My conclusion is that Windows 8 in its current form is very different; attractive in some ways, and disturbing in others.  It combines an interesting new interface with baffling changes to Windows compatibility, and amateur mistakes in customer messaging.  Add up all the changes, and I am very worried that Microsoft may be about to shoot itself in the foot spectacularly.
