> While Dropbox requires you to keep a copy of your data on their servers, btsync never requires your data to inhabit a device you do not own. This is nice for security, but it means to sync between two devices they both need to be online at the same time. That is where the Raspberry Pi comes in. You can use the Pi as a node in your sync network, so a change to a file on any device will sync with the Pi and then other devices will get the change when they come online.

Dropbox wäre zumindest ein Dienst weniger, den die NSA anzapfen kann.
