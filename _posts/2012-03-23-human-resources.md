[Let's pretend this never happened](http://thebloggess.com/2012/03/excerpt-of-lets-pretend-this-never-happened-a-mostly-true-memoir):
> Today a woman came in to reapply for a job. She wrote that she’d quit last month but now wanted her job back. On “reason for leaving” she wrote: "That job sucked. Plus, my supervisor was a douche-nugget." She was reapplying for the exact same job. I rehired her and reassigned her to her old supervisor, because I totally agreed with her. That guy was totally a douche-nugget.
