[Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/):

>I think the most important and severe is the fact that, as soon as another developer sees that someone used !important, they feel less bad about doing the same; the next developer who comes along and sees that someone bodged something doesnâ€™t feel too guilty about hacking something else. The first bits of bad code set a precedent and make subsequent developers feel less bad about using poor code themselves.

Schuldig im Sinne der Anklage.
