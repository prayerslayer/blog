[Classnames for styling, data-attributes for behaviour](http://blog.realstuffforabstractpeople.com/post/31753521367/classnames-for-styling-data-attributes-for-behavior):

> For a while I’ve been using a rule-of-thumb that I’d like to share with you. Basically, when attaching behavior to html elements, in the form of event handlers and such, I use data-attributes to identify elements rather than classnames.

Gute und sinnvolle Beobachtung.
