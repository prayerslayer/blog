[Craig Mod](http://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing) über [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/) von Marco Arment als Beispiel dafür, wie digitale Magazine aussehen sollen:

> Honda was a nobody in the car industry. But they gained foothold and marketshare by building a car that was more appropriate for many consumers. They had built a subcompact.
>
> So I ask: where are our digital publishing subcompacts?
