[The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/the-11-ways-that-consumers-are-hopeless-at-math/259479/) hat einen tollen Artikel über die Gründe, warum wir beschissene Einkäufer sind. Darunter sind auch ziemlich gemeine, wie ich finde, beispielsweise der Einfluss der ersten Zahl, die wir wahrnehmen:

> You walk into a high-end store, let's say it's Hermès, and you see a $7,000 bag. "Haha, that's so stupid!" you tell your friend. "Seven grand for a bag!" Then you spot an awesome watch for $367. Compared to a Timex, that's wildly over-expensive. But compared to the $7,000 price tag you just put to memory, it's a steal. In this way, stores can massage or "anchor" your expectations for spending.

Und das ist noch nicht einmal alles. Wir sind zusätzlich dazu auch Gewohnheitstiere und deswegen anfällig für statistische Analysen. Die [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all) hatte vor ein paar Monaten einen ausführlichen Artikel darüber:

> About a year after Pole created his pregnancy-prediction model, a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation.
>
> My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”
>
> The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.
>
> On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.”

Beide Artikel sind sehr interessant und lesenswert. Kann auch beim Einkaufen helfen, wenn die Tricks bekannt sind.
