[IBM Watson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFR3lOm_xhE) bekam das [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/) zu lesen. Das Problem:

> Watson couldn't distinguish between polite language and profanity - which the Urban Dictionary is full of. Watson picked up some bad habits from reading Wikipedia as well. In tests it even used the word "bullshit" in an answer to a researcher's query.

Die Entwickler haben es dann wieder gel√∂scht.
