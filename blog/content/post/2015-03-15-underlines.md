You know all the CSS generators like [CSSmatic](http://www.cssmatic.com/) or [CSS arrow please](http://cssarrowplease.com/)? I was looking for something similar, but for [Medium](https://medium.com/)-style text underlines (using `background-image`) and, strangely, unable to find it. So here it is: [underlin.es](http://prayerslayer.github.io/underlines/).

It’s called “underlin.es” like it was hosted on [underlin.es](http://underlin.es/), but it’s not. Originally I had the intention to, but at 1:30 AM I just wanted to get it done.
