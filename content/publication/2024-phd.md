I [defended](https://www.cvast.tuwien.ac.at/news/2024-07/cheers-nikolaus-successful-phd-defense-and-new-adventures) my Ph.D.! You can find my thesis [here](/media/phd-thesis.pdf), if you are interested.

The context of my research was a statistical analysis method that one could summarize as "Principal Component Analysis for Temporal or Spatial Data". The method has certain properties that can improve/ease the analysis and modeling of temporal/spatial datasets, but it does not come for free: Challenges when applying the method are the intricate and vast parameter space and the amount of components to compare. We tackled these in the individual [publications](/publication/) by developing specialized interactive visualizations coupled with appropriate data mining algorithms (visual analytics).
