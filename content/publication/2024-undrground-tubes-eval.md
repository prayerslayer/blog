  Real-world datasets often consist of quantitative and categorical variables. The analyst needs to focus on either kind separately or both jointly. We proposed a visualization technique tackling these challenges that supports visual cluster and set analysis. In this paper, we investigate how its visualization parameters affect the accuracy and speed of cluster and set analysis tasks in a controlled experiment. Our findings show that, with the proper settings, our visualization can support both task types well. However, we did not find settings suitable for the joint task, which provides opportunities for future research.
