You probably came across some visuals that can be categorized as [Glitch Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art). For instance, it’s heavily used in [Pony Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vLzSh1UKgs) as you modify the code of and break out of the haunted arcade machine.

I generally like this style a lot and wanted to find out what needs to be done to glitch some images of classic art. As somebody already did it for [the PNG format](https://ucnv.github.io/pnglitch/), I focused on JPEG.

How does one go about it? I figured it’s easiest to overwrite the file content here and there (a technique known as databending). So naturally, first I looked for some specs of the JPEG file format. There is no free authoritative source, as far as I know, so you puzzle everything together using a hex editor and [the](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf) [internet](http://vip.sugovica.hu/Sardi/kepnezo/JPEG%20File%20Layout%20and%20Format.htm).

Then you learn that a JPEG file can contain multiple scans (think of progressive JPEGs), and there scans are separated by start-of-scan markers. Then follows a header, which you can skip, and after the header the actual compressed image starts.

So the idea was to write a small program that reads a JPEG and overwrites random bytes in all scans: [glitch](https://github.com/prayerslayer/glitch) (Rust).

## Results

Fun fact, different software will have different issues with those glitched JPEGs. MacOS’ Preview often stops rendering after a few glitched bytes and displays the rest in gray. Chrome is generally very forgiving and renders all images somehow, and I used it to display the images above (and made a screenshot). Firefox will either render nothing or everything. So I assume there are some checksums somewhere that don’t work out anymore after glitching.
