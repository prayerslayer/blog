Glitch Art, looks nice, how is it made?

Probably by changing file content?

Figure out file content:

https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf
http://vip.sugovica.hu/Sardi/kepnezo/JPEG%20File%20Layout%20and%20Format.htm

See that there's a scan header, and scan content. File can have multiple scans (progressive jpeg).

So idea, read bytes, skip until scan header, skip that too and poke in bytes in scan.

How to poke? Two approaches: change slightly or random overwrite.
How much to poke? No idea so vary it, but can't be too much or file will be corrupted.

## Result
