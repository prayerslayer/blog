      <title>App-wide CLI Configuration in Python</title>

      <description>Recently I had the situation where I had a Python-based program to be used in a command line interface (CLI). But the program had many configuration options and I wanted a flexible way to deal with defaults and overriding them, while changing as little code as possible. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find great results on Google&amp;rsquo;s first page, so I thought I write it up here.
The problem with a reasonably large Python program, where code is distributed into several modules, is that we cannot really just pass a config dictionary around.</description>

      <title>My first mechanical keyboard, and how you can get one too</title>

      <description>People in my Twitter stream would post pictures of their workplace every once in a while. More often than not, the picture would feature a fancy keyboard. I would then search the internet about it, get intringued, and leave it at that. But recently I went for it.
I’ll first list some advantages of custom mechanical keyboards, and then do my best to walk you through the process of getting your own.</description>

      <description>When I travel I like to get a feeling for the music from the place I will visit. Who are the romantic singers one should know? What was the popular boyband in the 90s? For a recent trip I copied artist names from a Wikipedia page into the Spotify search, and that clearly doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale.
Prior Art There are several playlists from Spotify for kind of this purpose (&amp;ldquo;The Needle&amp;rdquo;), but they give me popular music in that place, ie.</description>

      <title>Inspecting React Children</title>

      <description>Suppose you write a frontend framework in React, like Bootstrap. (If it’s for the web or react-native doesn’t matter for the argument.) There are components for different text styles (MediumText, SmallText…), for popular control elements (Dropdown, Button…) and so on. You want this to be modular and composable, so you pass a different text component to the Button instead of setting a size property on it. After all, the button size depends only on the content, why would you have a large button with small text inside?</description>

      <description>You probably came across some visuals that can be categorized as Glitch Art. For instance, it’s heavily used in Pony Island as you modify the code and break out of the haunted arcade machine.
I generally like this style a lot and wanted to find out what needs to be done to glitch some images of classic art. As somebody already did it for the PNG format, I focused on JPEG.</description>

      <description>Bugs are a long-standing problem in the software industry: Invisible characters crash iOS Messages. FaceTime enables microphone before the call starts.. An integer underflow causes Gandhi to be super-aggressive in the original Civilization. There are many more examples.
One way to achieve code correctness that was always mysterious to me is formal verification: You prove logically that the code does what you claim. (NB: It’s not the only nor the best nor most efficient way to achieve the goal.</description>

      <title>symdiff: prevent dead css</title>

      <description>Some time ago I wrote a gulp plugin to enforce clean CSS in your frontend build. The idea, which I have from Github, is to break said build when the sets of classes in CSS and templates are not equal. This way you make sure you’re always actually using the styles you define and keep the amount of classes in your templates to a minimum.
I find it very useful and as of time of writing some 230 people on Github agree with me.</description>

      <title>Footnotes in pure CSS</title>

      <description>Being a web developer is as much a blessing as it is a curse. One moment you’re reading an article about the most untradable players in the NBA by your favorite basketball author, the next you’re creeping around the footnote implementation of their site and wondering if Javascript is really necessary there.1
Of course it isn’t. There are games written completely in CSS. And they are also the solution to our problem.</description>

      <description>You know all the CSS generators like CSSmatic or CSS arrow please? I was looking for something similar, but for Medium-style text underlines (using background-image) and, strangely, unable to find it. So here it is: underlin.es.
It’s called “underlin.es” like it was hosted on underlin.es, but it’s not. Originally I had the intention to, but at 1:30 AM I just wanted to get it done.</description>

      <description>Back from the days in university: In a two-week seminar we built an app for Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s giant screen-as-a-table. The idea is to make furniture planning possible without physically moving furniture.</description>
