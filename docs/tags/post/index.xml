      <title>App-wide CLI Configuration in Python</title>

      <description>Recently I had the situation where I had a Python-based program to be used in a command line interface (CLI). But the program had many configuration options and I wanted a flexible way to deal with defaults and overriding them, while changing as little code as possible. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find great results on Google&amp;rsquo;s first page, so I thought I write it up here.
The problem with a reasonably large Python program, where code is distributed into several modules, is that we cannot really just pass a config dictionary around.</description>

      <description>People in my Twitter stream would post pictures of their workplace every once in a while. More often than not, the picture would feature a fancy keyboard. I would then search the internet about it, get intringued, and leave it at that. But recently I went for it.
I’ll first list some advantages of custom mechanical keyboards, and then do my best to walk you through the process of getting your own.</description>

      <title>Inspecting React Children</title>

      <description>Suppose you write a frontend framework in React, like Bootstrap. (If it’s for the web or react-native doesn’t matter for the argument.) There are components for different text styles (MediumText, SmallText…), for popular control elements (Dropdown, Button…) and so on. You want this to be modular and composable, so you pass a different text component to the Button instead of setting a size property on it. After all, the button size depends only on the content, why would you have a large button with small text inside?</description>

      <title>Footnotes in pure CSS</title>

      <description>Being a web developer is as much a blessing as it is a curse. One moment you’re reading an article about the most untradable players in the NBA by your favorite basketball author, the next you’re creeping around the footnote implementation of their site and wondering if Javascript is really necessary there.1
Of course it isn’t. There are games written completely in CSS. And they are also the solution to our problem.</description>
