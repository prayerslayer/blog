## University

From 2008 to 2013 I studied Media Computer Science at [Dresden University of Technology](http://tu-dresden.de/en). I was—and still am—interested in everything web-related, so I attended courses about Security & Cryptography, Databases/Information Retrieval, Software Design and Media Design. My [thesis]({% post_url 2013-11-19-diplom %}) was about user assistance in composite information visualizations or mashups. I finished with a grade of 1.6.
		
## Civil service

11 months from 2007 to 2008 at [Caritas Jugendstreetwork, Graz](http://jugendstreetwork.caritas-steiermark.at/). I coded their CRM of sorts during this time.
